# Basic setup

I decided to use Bazel to manage things, since I'm already very familiar with
the Google-internal equivalent and I know it supports Pip. The first thing that
needs to be set up is the `WORKSPACE` file. This does three things. First, we
create the workspace:

```python
workspace(name = "nmigen_nexys")
```

Then, we make the Python and Pip rules available:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "rules_python",
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/releases/download/0.0.1/rules_python-0.0.1.tar.gz",
    sha256 = "aa96a691d3a8177f3215b14b0edc9641787abaaa30363a080165d06ab65e1161",
)

load("@rules_python//python:pip.bzl", "pip_repositories")
load("@rules_python//python:repositories.bzl", "py_repositories")
pip_repositories()
py_repositories()
```

Finally, we point Pip to its requirements file and make the autogenerated Bazel
targets available:

```python
load("@rules_python//python:pip.bzl", "pip_import")
pip_import(
    name = "pip_deps",
    requirements = "//:pip_requirements.txt",
)

load("@pip_deps//:requirements.bzl", "pip_install")
pip_install()
```

Per nMigen's installation instructions, we then add the nMigen toolchain and
board repositories to the requirements file:

```
git+https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen.git
git+https://github.com/m-labs/nmigen-boards.git
```

To make the reference `//:pip_requirements.txt` valid, the package `//` has to
exist. This is done by just adding an empty `BUILD` file at the top level of the
repository. Finally, running `bazel build //:all` verifies that nothing is
broken. I actually ran into some error with `bdist_wheel` the first time I tried
this. Running `pip3 install wheel` and updating fixed the problem:

```
$ bazel build //:all
